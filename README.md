[00:15.67] First time in a long time
[00:19.78] Hurtin' deeply inside
[00:25.38] First time in a long time
[00:29.40] Hurtin' deeply
[00:36.40] 
[00:33.13] Trust
[00:35.18] Trust who?
[00:37.66] Watchin' my back even when I'm in the booth
[00:40.27] Oh, trust who?
[00:43.21] Doin' my thing, but I'm down to come clean, not like you
[00:49.14] I wanna make you feel the weight's off your shoulders too
[00:55.02] I'll take it
[01:01.02] 
[00:59.87] Just tell me it can't be that crazy
[01:02.81] And even if it is that crazy, baby
[01:06.25] I'll take it
[01:09.58] I want you, I know you're not an angel
[01:14.43] Not you
[01:17.99] Oh, just save it
[01:22.55] Don't waste your time
[01:33.05] 
[01:24.96] 'Cause I'm wavy and I'm sayin' things
[01:27.81] That I don't mean, but I do mean
[01:30.58] And I don't want you to miss me
[01:33.27] 'Cause there's no way that you're sorry
[01:36.09] And you're crying and you're sayin' things
[01:39.01] That I do believe, but I don't even
[01:41.90] Want you to get in my mind
[01:44.62] I'm supposed to be in your mind (oh woah)
[01:47.39] For the first time in a long time
[01:50.46] For the first time in a long
[01:53.42] First time in the longest time
[02:08.42] 
[01:56.33] First time in a long time
[02:00.25] Hurtin' deeply inside
[02:05.80] First time in a long time
[02:10.11] Hurtin' deeply
[02:17.11] 
[02:13.84] Yeah (now, oh)
[02:18.00] Ayy (baby)
[02:22.44] (Hurtin' deeply inside)
[02:26.72] Trust
[02:30.27] Trust
[02:35.51] Trust
[02:37.63] Trust who?
[02:42.63] 
[02:39.62] Trust me and I can set you free
[02:42.43] Left your man, came straight to me
[02:45.31] You the real MVP (my love)
[02:47.74] Ride dirty like Pimp C
[02:50.48] You a real ten-speed freak, shawty
[02:53.20] You was everything a nigga need
[02:56.08] You was everything to me, my love
[03:12.58] 
[03:01.38] Why you keep that little shit from me?
[03:04.05] Left me down on bended knee
[03:06.44] When I scooped you in the Maybach
[03:08.29] The only time a nigga ever made you take a backseat
[03:12.24] Why you do that little shit to me, shawty?
[03:14.81] When you know that we was meant to be
[03:17.39] Why'd you keep those things from me, my love? (Love)
[03:23.95] I've given you enough time
[03:36.95] 
[03:27.32] (Hurtin' deeply inside)
[03:31.82] Trust
[03:34.84] Trust
[03:38.18] Hurtin' deeply, deeply
[03:49.18] 
[03:43.54] Thought I knew the real, then they flipped
[03:45.68] How many times did I ask about this, on God?
[03:48.94] Why you let me find out like this, on God?
[03:51.54] Houston, we got a problem, my dawg
[03:54.39] All my niggas love you, got us all involved
[03:57.19] Ain't no goin' back to how we started off
[04:00.45] No, no, no, no
